# HospitalDatabase
Hospital Database system Made in C#.

Note that the goal was not the display, but rather the methods involved. I might get back in and make the display with JavaFX in order to have
a proper user-friendly system. The DatabaseConnector was very much inspired by my friend and good programmer @jeegnathebug, and 
helped me a lot in the making of this system.
